# Stock Stability Checker Agent

An AI-powered stock stability analysis agent following the S9 architecture pattern. This agent specializes in analyzing stock stability using EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth metrics.

## Architecture Overview

This agent follows the S9 multi-agent architecture with:
- **AgentLoop**: Main execution loop with perception, planning, and action phases
- **MCP Servers**: Modular tool providers for stock analysis capabilities
- **Memory Management**: Session-based memory for analysis continuity
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for intelligent reasoning and data extraction

## 6-Step Workflow

1. **Ticker Symbol Resolution** â†’ Get ticker from company name if needed
2. **EPS Data Collection** â†’ Fetch 4 years of EPS data from multiple sources
3. **Trend Analysis** â†’ Check if EPS is consistently increasing
4. **Growth Rate Calculation** â†’ Calculate compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
5. **Stability Assessment** â†’ Apply criteria: EPS increasing AND growth > 10%
6. **Final Recommendation** â†’ Generate detailed reasoning and decision

## Usage

```bash
cd agents/stability_checker_agent
python agent.py
```
