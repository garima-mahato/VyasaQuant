INDUSTRY\n\nAerospace & Defence (A&D) Industry is a vast industry which encompasses Commercial and General Aviation, Military aircraft, Space systems, Ground Defence and Shipbuilding. In 2023, A&D industry has recovered from COVID disruptions in both Civil and Defence segments. The Defence segment is expected to grow in 2024-25 as many countries have significantly increased Defence budgets to strengthen their military capabilities due to global geopolitical conflicts. In Civil segment the global passenger traffic has reached to pre COVID level by the end of 2023. This has become a driving factor for large size manufacturing orders and aftersales activities in the A&D industry.\n\nDefence procurements are guided by the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP-2020) which lays down emphasis on higher indigenous content. To propel indigenisation, Five Positive Indigenisation Lists (PIL) have been issued by Department of Military Affairs (DMA), in which 21 items of HAL are listed. Major platforms included under these lists are Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mk1A, Light Combat Helicopter (LCH), Transport Aircraft (Do-228), Basic Trainer Aircraft (HTT-40), Small Jet Engines (PTAE), and Light Utility Helicopter (LUH).\n# 1.1 Global Scenario\n\n# 1.1.1\n\nReports have estimated that the global A&D industry to grow from $884 billion in 2023 to around $1230 billion in next five years. The major driving force in the Defence segment is global geopolitical situation, whereas in civil segment increasing passenger traffic is driving the market growth.\n# 1.1.2\n\nThe key challenges in the industry are supply chain dependencies, pressure to achieve high efficiency, low cost of production and workforce management. As solution, OEMs are looking for local sources for materials and components. Additionally to achieve efficiencies OEMs are moving towards innovation, digital technologies and smart factories.\n# 2. ORGANISATION STRUCTURE\n\n# 2.1\n\nPresently, HAL has 20 Production and 9 R&D Centres. These Divisions and R&D Centres are located at ten geographic locations in seven States across the Country. HAL’s Divisions and R&D Centres are organized into five complexes with current & future operations given below:\n\n- Bangalore Complex (BC): Production, MRO and upgrade of Fixed-wing Aircraft and Engines of Indian and Western Origin, Aerospace Structures, Castings, Forgings & Rolled Rings.\n- MiG Complex (MC): Production of indigenous Fixed-wing aircraft, Production, MRO and upgrade of Fixed-wing aircraft and Engines of mainly Russian Origin, Civil MRO and UAV Projects.\n- Helicopter Complex (HC): Production, MRO and upgrade of Helicopters of Indian and Western Origin.\n- Accessories Complex (AC): Production, MRO and upgrade of Transport aircraft, Production and MRO of Accessories and Avionics for Fixed-wing and Rotary-wing Platforms (Indian, Russian and Western Origin), Depot Level Maintenance of UAVs.\n- Design Complex (DC): R&D of Fixed-wing and Rotary-wing aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Aero-engines, Avionics and Accessories.\n\nBC, MC, HC and AC are headed by Chief Executive Officers (CEOs).
